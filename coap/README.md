## Deployment

The service itself is distributed as Docker container. Check the [`coap-adapter`](https://github.com/absmach/supermq/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml) service section in docker-compose file to see how service is deployed.

Running this service outside of container requires working instance of the message broker service, clients service and Jaeger server.
To start the service outside of the container, execute the following shell script:

```bash
# download the latest version of the service
git clone https://github.com/absmach/supermq

cd magistrala

# compile the http
make coap

# copy binary to bin
make install

# set the environment variables and run the service
SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_LOG_LEVEL=info \
SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_HOST=localhost \
SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_PORT=5683 \
SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_SERVER_CERT="" \
SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_SERVER_KEY="" \
SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_HTTP_HOST=localhost \
SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_HTTP_PORT=5683 \
SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_HTTP_SERVER_CERT="" \
SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_HTTP_SERVER_KEY="" \
SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_URL=localhost:7000 \
SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_TIMEOUT=1s \
SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_CLIENT_CERT="" \
SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_CLIENT_KEY="" \
SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_SERVER_CERTS="" \
SMQ_MESSAGE_BROKER_URL=nats://localhost:4222 \
SMQ_JAEGER_URL=http://localhost:14268/api/traces \
SMQ_JAEGER_TRACE_RATIO=1.0 \
SMQ_SEND_TELEMETRY=true \
SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_INSTANCE_ID="" \
$GOBIN/supermq-coap
```

Setting `SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_SERVER_CERT` and `SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_SERVER_KEY` will enable TLS against the service. The service expects a file in PEM format for both the certificate and the key. Setting `SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_HTTP_SERVER_CERT` and `SMQ_COAP_ADAPTER_HTTP_SERVER_KEY` will enable TLS against the service. The service expects a file in PEM format for both the certificate and the key.

Setting `SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_CLIENT_CERT` and `SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_CLIENT_KEY` will enable TLS against the clients service. The service expects a file in PEM format for both the certificate and the key. Setting `SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_SERVER_CERTS` will enable TLS against the clients service trusting only those CAs that are provided. The service expects a file in PEM format of trusted CAs.

## Usage

If CoAP adapter is running locally (on default 5683 port), a valid URL would be: `coap://localhost/channels/<channel_id>/messages?auth=<client_auth_key>`.
Since CoAP protocol does not support `Authorization` header (option) and options have limited size, in order to send CoAP messages, valid `auth` value (a valid Client key) must be present in `Uri-Query` option.
