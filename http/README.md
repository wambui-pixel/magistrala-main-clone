## Deployment

The service itself is distributed as Docker container. Check the [`http-adapter`](https://github.com/absmach/supermq/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml) service section in docker-compose file to see how service is deployed.

Running this service outside of container requires working instance of the message broker service, clients service and Jaeger server.
To start the service outside of the container, execute the following shell script:

```bash
# download the latest version of the service
git clone https://github.com/absmach/supermq

cd supermq

# compile the http
make http

# copy binary to bin
make install

# set the environment variables and run the service
SMQ_HTTP_ADAPTER_LOG_LEVEL=info \
SMQ_HTTP_ADAPTER_HOST=localhost \
SMQ_HTTP_ADAPTER_PORT=80 \
SMQ_HTTP_ADAPTER_SERVER_CERT="" \
SMQ_HTTP_ADAPTER_SERVER_KEY="" \
SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_URL=localhost:7000 \
SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_TIMEOUT=1s \
SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_CLIENT_CERT="" \
SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_CLIENT_KEY="" \
SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_SERVER_CERTS="" \
SMQ_MESSAGE_BROKER_URL=nats://localhost:4222 \
SMQ_JAEGER_URL=http://localhost:14268/api/traces \
SMQ_JAEGER_TRACE_RATIO=1.0 \
SMQ_SEND_TELEMETRY=true \
SMQ_HTTP_ADAPTER_INSTANCE_ID="" \
$GOBIN/supermq-http
```

Setting `SMQ_HTTP_ADAPTER_SERVER_CERT` and `SMQ_HTTP_ADAPTER_SERVER_KEY` will enable TLS against the service. The service expects a file in PEM format for both the certificate and the key.

Setting `SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_CLIENT_CERT` and `SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_CLIENT_KEY` will enable TLS against the clients service. The service expects a file in PEM format for both the certificate and the key. Setting `SMQ_CLIENTS_AUTH_GRPC_SERVER_CERTS` will enable TLS against the clients service trusting only those CAs that are provided. The service expects a file in PEM format of trusted CAs.

## Usage

HTTP Authorization request header contains the credentials to authenticate a Client. The authorization header can be a plain Client key or a Client key encoded as a password for Basic Authentication. In case the Basic Authentication schema is used, the username is ignored. For more information about service capabilities and its usage, please check out the [API documentation](https://docs.api.supermq.abstractmachines.fr/?urls.primaryName=http.yml).
