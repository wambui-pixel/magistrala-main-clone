## Introduction 📖

SuperMQ is a distributed, highly scalable, and secure open-source cloud platform for messaging and event-driven architecture (EDA). It is a planetarily distributed, highly scalable, and secure platform that serves as a robust foundation for building advanced real-time and reactive systems.

## Why SuperMQ Stands Out 🚀

SuperMQ bridges the gap between various network protocols (HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP, and more) to provide a seamless messaging experience. Whether you're working on IoT solutions, real-time data pipelines, or event-driven systems, SuperMQ has you covered. 🌐✨

## Key Features 🌟

- **Multi-Protocol Connectivity**: HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP, and more! 🌉
- **Secure by Design**: Mutual TLS (mTLS) with X.509 Certificates, JWT support, and multi-protocol authorization. 🔒
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Support for ABAC and RBAC policies. 📜
- **Multi-Tenant**: Manage multiple domains seamlessly. 🏢
- **Multi-User**: Unlimited organizational hierarchies for user management. 👥
- **Application Management**: Group and share messaging clients for streamlined operations. 📱
- **Ease of Use**: Simple and powerful communication channel management, grouping, and sharing. ✨
- **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**: Scoped and revocable tokens for enhanced security. 🔑
- **Observability**: Integrated logging and instrumentation with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry. 📈
- **Event Sourcing**: Build robust and scalable architectures. ⚡
- **Edge and IoT Ready**: Supports MQTT and CoAP protocols for seamless IoT gateway and sensor communication and management. 🌍
- **Developer-Friendly**: SDKs, CLI tools, and comprehensive documentation to get you started. 👩‍💻👨‍💻
- **Production-Ready**: Container-based deployment using Docker and Kubernetes. 🐳☸️

## Installation 🛠️

Clone the repository and start SuperMQ services:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/absmach/supermq.git
cd supermq
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file docker/.env up
```

Or use the [Makefile](Makefile) for a simpler command:

```bash
make run
```

For production deployments, check our [Kubernetes guide](https://docs.supermq.abstractmachines.fr/kubernetes). ⚙️

### Usage 📤📥

#### Using the CLI:

```bash
make cli
./build/supermq-cli status
```

This command retrieves the status of the SuperMQ server and outputs it to the console.

#### Using HTTP with Curl:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/status
```

This request fetches the server status over HTTP and provides a JSON response.

See our [CLI documentation](https://docs.supermq.abstractmachines.fr/cli) for more details.
